        <p>Brenda Long, Josh Barton, Scott Silver, Tyler Hilliard, Bryan Ford, & Kipp Menton.</p>
<p>For showing us we are capable of learning new things, even when it seems impossible. For being encouraging and believing in us, even when we felt the imposter syndrome. For painstakingly reviewing code to find that extra curly bracket, and helping us grow from our mistakes.</p> 
  <p>We are so thankful to have taken these first steps into the development world with you by our side.</p>
        <h6>OUR GUEST SPEAKERS</h6>
        <p>For showing us a glimpse into the development world and life after graduation. For teaching us about the world of networking and how to market ourselves. </p>
